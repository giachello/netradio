# Netradio
This is a new media source for the Home Assistant home automation framework, that allows you to define a set of web radio stations (e.g., http://streams.greenhost.nl:8080/jazz) and then play them from a service call or by using a custom Lovelace card.

## Minimum Home Assistant version

Netradio is compatible with any version since 2021.1.1

## Setup

To setup the integration, install it through Hacs or by copying the files in your `custom_components/netradio` folders. Then, add configurations for your radios in configuration.yaml. If you want to use the Lovelace interface, install it through Hacs or copy the files in the `www/` folder in your `www` folder.
